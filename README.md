# NAME OF THE PROJECT :- INCORRECT CARTOON CHARACTER

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Imagine this: you get to choose your character – it could be Cinderella or Shin-chan. Then, you're thrown into their story which was supposed to unfold as planned. But here's the twist: your choices matter! Every decision you make will send the story down a different path. You could befriend the villain or accidentally slap the prince. The possibilities are as endless as a bowl of bottomless gummy bears!

Just remember, in this world, the only rule is that there are no rules! Well, except for one: don't eat the talking mushrooms. Trust me, they taste like gym socks and existential dread. So, go forth, brave adventurer, and make your mark on this gloriously goofy world! Just don't forget to bring your sense of humor and a spare pair of pants – things might get messy.
